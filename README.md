This is an assignment done in Asia Pacific University Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering, YEAR 2 Semester 1.

This is a group assignment but each member has their own individual parts to complete.
This is the part where I have written the code learning from external sources to maximize the usage of GGPLOT2 and other various packages.

Improvements like machine learning could be added to the code to produce a better output and better analysis for the users.
